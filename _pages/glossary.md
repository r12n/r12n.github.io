Here is a brief glossary of terms that may be useful. Please contact me or [submit a pull request](https://github.com/r12n/r12n.github.io)s with your additions!

### endangered language

An endangered language is a language that is at risk of falling out of use as its speakers die out or shift to speaking another language. Language loss occurs when the language has no more native speakers and becomes a "dead language". If eventually no one speaks the language at all, it becomes an "extinct language". Although languages have always become extinct throughout human history, they are currently disappearing at an accelerated rate by the processes of globalization and neocolonialism, and the economically powerful languages dominate other languages. (adapted from [Endangered language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endangered_language) in Wikipedia)

### heritage language

A heritage language is the language someone learns at home as a child which is a minority language in a society, but because of growing up with a dominant language, the speaker seems more competent in the latter and feels more comfortable communicating in that language. In some countries or cultures where they determine one's mother tongue by the ethnic group, a heritage language would be linked to native language. The term can also refer to the language of a person's family or community, which the person does not speak or understand but with which they culturally identify. (adapted from [Heritage language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heritage_language) in Wikipedia)

### indigenous language

An indigenous language is a language that is native to a region and spoken by indigenous people. This language would be from a linguistically distinct community that has been settled in the area for many generations. Indigenous languages are not necessarily national languages, and the reverse is also true. Many indigenous peoples worldwide have stopped passing on their ancestral languages to the next generation, and have instead adopted the [majority language](#majority-language) as part of their acculturation into the majority culture. (adapted from [Indigenous language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_language) in Wikipedia)

### internationalization (i18n)

"Internationalization is the design and development of a product, application or document content that enables easy [localization](#localization-l10n) for target audiences that vary in culture, region, or language." ([source](https://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-i18n))

### locale

In computing, a locale is a set of parameters that defines the user's language, region and any special variant preferences that the user wants to see in their user interface. Usually a locale identifier consists of at least a language identifier and a region identifier.

### localization (l10n)

Language localization is the process of adapting a product that has been previously translated into multiple languages to a specific country or region. It is the second phase of a larger process of product translation and cultural adaptation (for specific countries, regions or groups) to account for differences in distinct markets, a process known as [internationalization](#internationalization-i18n) and localization. Localization can be referred to by the numeronym L10N (as in: "L", followed by ten more letters, and then "N").

The localization process is most generally related to the cultural adaptation and translation of software, video games and websites, as well as audio/voiceover, video or other multimedia content, and less frequently to any written translation (which may also involve cultural adaptation processes). (adapted from [Language localisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_localisation) in Wikipedia)

### minority language

A minority language is a language spoken by a minority of the population of a territory. Such people are termed linguistic minorities or language minorities. With a total number of 193 sovereign states recognized internationally (as of 2008) and an estimated number of roughly 5,000 to 7,000 languages spoken worldwide, it follows that the vast majority of languages are minority languages in every country in which they are spoken. Some minority languages are simultaneously also official languages, including the Irish language in Ireland. Likewise, some national languages are often considered minority languages, insofar as they are the national language of a stateless nation. (adapted from [Minority language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minority_language) in Wikipedia)

### optical character recognition (OCR)

Optical character recognition (also optical character reader, OCR) is electronic conversion of images of typed, handwritten or printed text into machine-encoded text, whether from a scanned document, a photo of a document, a scene-photo (for example the text on signs and billboards in a landscape photo). It is a common method of digitising printed texts so that they can be electronically edited, searched, stored more compactly, displayed on-line, and used in machine processes such as cognitive computing, machine translation, (extracted) text-to-speech, key data and text mining. OCR is a field of research in pattern recognition, artificial intelligence and computer vision. (adapted from [Optical character recognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition) in Wikipedia)

### open source

The term "open source" refers to something people can modify and share because its design is publicly accessible. The term originated in the context of software development to designate a [specific approach to creating computer programs](#open-source-software). Today, however, "open source" designates a broader set of values. Open source projects, products, or initiatives embrace and celebrate principles of open exchange, collaborative participation, rapid prototyping, transparency, meritocracy, and community-oriented development. (adapted from [opensource.com](https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source))

### open source software

Open source software is software with source code that anyone can inspect, modify, and enhance. "Source code" is the part of software that most computer users don't ever see; it's the code computer programmers can manipulate to change how a piece of software—a "program" or "application"—works. Programmers who have access to a computer program's source code can improve that program by adding features to it or fixing parts that don't always work correctly. (adapted from [opensource.com](https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source))

### revitalization

Language revitalization, also referred to as language revival or reversing language shift, is an attempt to halt or reverse the decline of a language or to revive an extinct one. Those involved can include parties such as linguists, cultural or community groups, or governments.

Languages targeted for language revitalization include those whose use and prominence is severely limited, called [endangered](#endangered-language) or weakening, or those that have only a few elderly speakers and seem to be dying, called moribund. Sometimes various tactics of language revitalization can even be used to try and revive extinct languages. Though the goals of language revitalization vary greatly from case to case, they typically involve attempting to expand the number of speakers and use of a language, or trying to maintain the current level of use to protect the language from extinction or language death. (adapted from [Language revitalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_revitalization) in Wikipedia)

### string

In computing, a string is sequence of encoded characters or a unit of text.

### Unicode

Unicode is a computing industry standard for the consistent encoding, representation, and handling of text expressed in most of the world's writing systems. Developed in conjunction with the Universal Coded Character Set (UCS) standard and published as The Unicode Standard, the latest version of Unicode contains a repertoire of more than 128,000 characters covering 135 modern and historic scripts, as well as multiple symbol sets. The standard consists of a set of code charts for visual reference, an encoding method and set of standard character encodings, a set of reference data files, and a number of related items, such as character properties, rules for normalization, decomposition, collation, rendering, and bidirectional display order (for the correct display of text containing both right-to-left scripts, such as Arabic and Hebrew, and left-to-right scripts). (adapted from [Unicode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode))

### user experience (UX)

User experience (UX) refers to a person's emotions and attitudes about using a particular product, system or service. It includes the practical, experiential, affective, meaningful and valuable aspects of human–computer interaction and product ownership. Additionally, it includes a person’s perceptions of system aspects such as utility, ease of use and efficiency. User experience may be considered subjective in nature to the degree that it is about individual perception and thought with respect to the system. User experience is dynamic as it is constantly modified over time due to changing usage circumstances and changes to individual systems as well as the wider usage context in which they can be found. (adapted from [User experience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_experience))

### user interface (UI)

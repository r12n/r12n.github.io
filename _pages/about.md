r12n is an attempt to share best practices related to digital tools for language revitalization, and to better connect activists and educators from language communities with technologists. The focus is on open-source approaches to the development of learning and teaching technologies, digital communication platforms, and general software and apps.

*r12n* is a (nonstandard!) abbreviation for the term "revitalization," following abbreviations for software translation terms such internationalization (i18n) and localization (l10n).
